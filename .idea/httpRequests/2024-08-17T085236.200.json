We\n    are going to cover 3 basic ways of performing type narrowing in Typescript.\n</p>\n\n<p>Let's start with the following example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"typescript\">\ninterface Vehicle {\n    weight: number;\n    wheels?: number;\n    class?: 'A' | '1' | '2' |'3';\n}</pre\n>\n\n<p>\n    In our application we have different vehicles.
