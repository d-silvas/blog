<h1>Probability definitions</h1>

<p>Let \(\Omega\) be a set</p>

<p>
  <strong>Def 1.</strong> A <strong>\(\sigma\)-field</strong> is a collection
  \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) such that \(\emptyset \in
  \mathcal{F}\), and it's closed under complementation and under countable
  unions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Def 2.</strong> The sets that are members of \(\mathcal{F}\) are said
  to be <strong>measurable with respect to \(\mathcal{F}\)</strong>, or just
  <strong>measurable</strong> if the \(\sigma\)-field is understood from the
  context.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Def 3.</strong> A <strong>probability measure</strong> \(P\) on a \(\sigma\)-field
  \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) is a function:

\begin{align}
    P: &\mathcal{F}\longrightarrow \left[0, 1\right] \\
    &A \mapsto P(A)
\end{align}
such that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>\( P(\Omega) = 1 \)</li>
  <li>For each pairwise disjoint sequence of elements of \(\mathcal{F}\), ...</li>
</ol>
